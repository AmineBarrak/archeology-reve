The way we run the business
Recognising and responding to the impactof climate change on our business andsociety is not new to us. Climate risks and opportunities have formed part of our strategic thinking and investment decisions for over two decades. We nowhave a portfolio well positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy andwe are the only major diversified companyin the industry not involved in fossil fuel extraction. This means we are uniquely positioned but we, like many other businesses, still face significant challenges in meeting our climate change ambition and delivering tangible outcomes.
Our low-carbon ambition and targets
This year, we have set a new ambition toreach net zero emissions by 2050 across our operations. There is absolutely no doubtwe will face many challenges in achieving this ambition and it is true to say we do nothave a clear pathway to get there today. Wewill focus on reducing emissions across our operations, as we partner with others todevelop new technology solutions and lookfor ways to improve the quality of our products, to name but three key actions.
In 2019, we looked at our operations indetail to explore emission reduction opportunities for each and develop marginal abatement cost curves. This comprehensive work informed our 2030 targets which areto reduce our emissions intensity by 30%and our absolute emissions by 15%.
We believe these targets are stretching but achievable. We will, of course, striveto do more.
Overall, our growth between now and 2030will be carbon neutral.
We have also strengthened the link between executive remuneration andour climate targets.
A challenge and opportunity for us all
At Rio Tinto we know the best way todeliver our purpose to pioneer human progress is to run a safe, profitable and responsible business. This meanswe protect and care for our employees, communities and the environment while striving to generate long-term, sustainableprofits that enable us to invest in the future. This is at the heart of our approach to sustainability, including climate change.
For us it is about setting a long-term ambition, and establishing stretching but achievable targets, while always striving to do better. Climate changeis a global challenge and will requireaction across nations, across industries, and by society at large.
We are fully committed to meeting that challenge.

INTRODUCTION FROM J-S JACQUES
Our strategy is consistent with the Paris goals
To achieve our ambition, we will continueto pursue our strategy which is consistentwith the climate goals of the Paris
Agreement. We will take action in four areas:. Produce materials essential for a low-carbon future. Reduce the carbon footprint of our operations. Partner to reduce the carbon footprintacross our value chain. Enhance our resilience to physical climate risks
We are committed to transparent reporting of our performance againsteach of these areas and this, our secondclimate change report, shares our progress.
Our performance and collective action
Let me close with a short summary of our performance. Since 2008, we have reduced the absolute emissions from our managed operations by 46% (18% when excluding divestments) and have reduced our emissions intensity by 29%.
Today, 76% of our electricity consumptionat our managed operations is from renewable energy, compared with 26% of global electricity production. Most of our operations now have significantly lower carbon intensities than sector averages.
And we continue to improve our understanding and management of physical risk exposures.
For me, a highlight of our performance overthe years has been our ability to partner with others, including customers, governments, research and academic institutions and communities, to furthermutual climate and environmental goals.
In September 2019 we launched a pioneering initiative in the steel industry:we are partnering with China Baowu Steel
Group and Tsinghua University to develop solutions to help address the steel industry’s carbon footprint and improve its environmental performance. We aim to replicate this approach across all our key value chains, as we have in aluminium. Wewill share the goals and objectives of these partnerships as they develop.
Our purpose isto produce materials essential to human progress.
Materials such as aluminiumused in electric vehicles, copperused to build wind turbines and ironore used to create critical infrastructure.
As the world needs more materials andenergy to prosper and provide people witha better quality of life, it also needs materials that have been produced in both an economic and sustainable way, with fewer emissions and with respect for communities. We recognise both the challenge and opportunity in this and wantto be part of the solution.
Our goal is to play an active role in finding climate solutions and we will do this through partnerships. Everyone, from customers to suppliers, from communities to governments, and from civil society organisations to business, needs to play a part. This is why we are looking to collaborate with partners across the value chain. We do not have all the answers yet but I believe we are asking the right questions, especially of ourselves: whatmore can we do to contribute to climateaction across our entire business ecosystem as we provide the essential materials used to deliver human progress?
“We plan to invest around
$1 billionover five years in emissions reduction projects” 3Our approach to climate change Our approach to climate change
Our sustainability framework
We acknowledge the reality of climate changeand accept that it is largely causedby human activities. Without decisive actionto curb greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,climate change has the potential to severelyimpact our business, our communities and the world. Indeed, we are already experiencingsome of these negative impacts from extreme weather events.
We believe that feasible pathways exist todevelop a successful low-carbon economy, and as producers of the materials vital to this transition, we want to be part of the solution.
In 2015, we supported the outcomes of the
Paris Agreement and the long-term goal tolimit global average temperature rise to well below 2°C. We note the 2018 special report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change (IPCC) on the impacts of a 1.5°C warming scenario, which reinforces the needfor urgent action to address the threat ofclimate change and meet sustainable development goals.
We also recognise that there will be winnersand losers from the transition to a low-carbon economy. To be acceptable to society as a whole, any transition must include the continued provision of secure, affordable energy.
We recognise business, government andsociety all have a role to play to address the challenges and opportunities of climate change. Governments have an important role in overseeing the system-wide response.
This is our second report on climatechange which has been guided by the recommendations of the Task Force on
Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).
We are moving along the ‘implementation path’ the TCFD describes and this reportcovers our ambition and targets, strategy and approach, scenarios, risk management and governance, and performance.
Rio Tinto produces materials essential to human progress. Our activities contribute to economic growth and social development around the world, and our products touch almost everyaspect of daily life. Our aim is to generate long-term sustainable profits that enable us to invest in the future, safeguard the environment and to meet our responsibilities to our customers, employees, suppliers, host communities and governments.
We want to be a safe and profitable business, a responsible company and a great employer and partner. Our approach to sustainability is detailed in the framework below, and core to this is our carefor the environment. This includes how we manage land, water, air and of course, climate change.

Running a safe, responsible and profitable business
The foundation of our approach is to run a safe, responsible, sustainable and profitable business.
Collaborating to enable long-term economic benefits
We collaborate with othersto enable long-term benefitswhere we operate – working with governments at all levels and community partners tohelp make a difference in people’s lives.
Pioneering materialsfor human progress
We are helping to pioneer a more sustainable future – through examining our ownglobal carbon footprint,forming smart partnerships and producing materials that contribute to a low-carbon economy.
Our approach to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)
We continue to examine our approach to the UN SDGs in line with our integrated sustainability strategy. 5Our approach to climate change Our approach to climate change
Today, 76% of the electricity consumption at our managed operations is from renewable sources. We still have operations that are highly energy-intensiveand produce significant GHG emissions. The transition to a low-carboneconomy will therefore have a material impact on our long-term strategy and operations. A comprehensive assessment of the full range of impacts is challenging, since it must consider the interplay of technical, social and political factors over a long period of time. We therefore incorporate climate change considerations into our strategic planning, scenario analysis and commercial frameworks, to make sure that risks and opportunities can be comprehensively addressed. We have tested the resilience of our investmentsagainst a carbon price since 1998.
We consider the impact of climate change over the short-, mediumand long-term horizons.
The key uncertainties are changes in the regulatory response and the speed of development and adoptionof new technologies.. Short term (1 year): this is the timeframe forour annual financial planning. Medium term (2-10 years): our annual strategic planning cycle looks ten years ahead. Long-term (beyond 10 years): this is the timeframe for our long term outlook and scenario planning
Our approach to climate scenariosand carbon prices
Our Group strategy is developed from an understanding of the megatrends affecting theworld and our industry. We are facing a new era of complexity, which will be shaped over the next decadeby the interplay between three global dimensions: geopolitics, society and technology. We use scenario analysis to explore the uncertainty and complexity they bring, and assess the resulting threats to, and opportunities for, our business.
The transition to a low-carbon economy is critically important to our long-term strategy and operations.
Over the past year we have moved away from using standalone climate change scenarios and haveinstead fully integrated climate change considerationsinto the scenarios we use as part of our Group strategy process. We also continue to refer to the
International Energy Agency Sustainable
Development Scenario (IEA SDS) to test the resilienceof our business against an independent and externally recognised pathway to a well below 2°C outcome,aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement.
In 2019, global emissions rose by 0.6% to a record high of 36.8 billion tonnes of CO2 (excluding land use change, source: CICERO). PwC’s Low Carbon Economy
Index suggests that, after modest improvement since, progress in reducing the carbon intensity of theglobal economy has stalled. Despite significant increases in renewable energy and rising societal concerns about the impacts of climate change, thegap between the Paris Agreement goal and the world’s current pathway continues to grow.
Our internal use of carbon prices
One of the ways we respond to transition risks – suchas the potential impact of climate change policies on our business – is through the use of an internal price on carbon.
We have distinct price forecasts for the regions andmain markets in which we operate and sell our products. The carbon price assumptions used in ourcentral case valuations rise over time and are higherthan our previously used carbon price forecasts. Our approach enables us to test the future carbon costsof our businesses and investment proposals against alternative scenarios.
The impacts ofclimate change on our business
• Strong domestic, regionaland global collaboration
• Coordinated carbon policies
• Rapidly rising and converging carbon prices
• <2°C
This scenario assumes that sustainability, including climate change, continues to rise up the international agenda. At its core, it assumes a drive towards international collaboration and inclusive growth to reduce social inequalities.
A high level of collaboration between governments, business and consumers is essential for scenarios articulating rapid low-carbon transitions – led by strong domestic and global climate policy frameworks – to keep global warming below 2°C. Such scenarios assumecarbon prices reaching up to $120 / tCO2e by 2040 in developed countries, with developing countries catching up over time, and that emissions peak in the mid-2020s, reaching net zero by around. According to the World Bank,carbon pricing initiatives only cover approximately 15% of global emissions today. In about half of them, the price is less than $10 / tCO2e , which does notprovide an adequate incentive for rapid adoption of low-carbon technologies.
(World Bank, State and Trends of Carbon
Pricing 2019)
• Fast-paced technology development, dispersion and execution
• Low-cost low-carbon solutions
• Slower adoption due to lack of strong GHG emissions policies
• >2°C
This scenario assumes that the transitionto the fourth stage of industrialisation continues, defined by a step change in digital connectivity and intelligent systems, supported by advanced analytics and artificial intelligence. The transition is transformative in some sectors, but also creates major disruptions.
Opportunities emerge from the continued drop in the cost of low-carbon technologies. Scenarios built around afast pace of technology change show global emissions peaking and then falling, even without strong and coordinated carbon policies. However,this is likely to take place over a longer timeframe, and therefore result inwarming of more than 2°C by 2100.
• Political, economic and technological fragmentation
• Changing nature of US-China relationship
• Lack of global and regional coordination
• >3°C
Since the middle of the 20th century, the dynamics of geopolitics have beendefined by globalisation. It has been a dominant force for human progress.
China’s rapid development is the culmination of this effort and is unprecedented in history in terms ofscale and speed. This process of globalisation has faced new challenges in recent years, including a significant shiftin the relationship between the United
States and China.
In this scenario, political fragmentation, nationalism and populism provide headwinds to both the coordination of global policies and investment in new technologies. In scenarios built around those themes, global challenges such asclimate change are not proactively managed, global emissions remain highand global warming reaches well above°C by 2100.

Geopolitics Technology
We use three global dimensions to develop our Group strategy scenario framework and these result in a range of possible climate change outcomes which we include in our planning.Our approach to climate change 6 Our approach to climate change
The International Energy Agency
Sustainable Development Scenario
(IEA SDS) and pathways to 1.5°C
The IEA designed the SDS scenario as a plausible pathfor the global energy system that is fully aligned withthe goals of the Paris Agreement, while also meeting universal energy access and cleaner air objectives.
This scenario combines society and technology dimensions, to drive early adoption of multiple clean energy solutions and an immediate peak in global CO2 emissions, followed by an average decline of 3.8% peryear through to 2050. The SDS scenario is designed to be consistent with limiting global warming to below.8°C with a 66% probability, without reliance on global net-negative emissions in the longer term.
In light of the IPCC special report on the impacts of a.5°C warming scenario, the IEA has further expanded its thinking and, in its latest World Energy Outlook
(November 2019), considers trajectories to limitglobal warming to 1.5°C. In this assessment, the IEA considers that the modelled pathway of the SDS scenario to 2050 would be consistent with a 1.5°C outcome, with a 50% probability if emissions were to reach net-zero by 2070 and turn negative beyond that point. This would likely require the use of bioenergy,along with carbon capture and storage (CCS) technologies in the second half of the century.
The strength of our portfolio in the low-carbon transition
Our 2018 climate change report presented a high-level summary of potential impacts for our portfolio under the IEA SDS scenario. Our methodology here is unchanged, with some small refinements to the approach and assumptions used to consider implications for the demand, industry structure andprices of our key commodities.
Our analysis continues to show that our business isrobust in the transition to a low-carbon economy. The diversity of our commodity portfolio enhances the resilience of our business as climate change policies are implemented. We also expect to see structural changesacross our value chains as consumers demand greener products. The potential downsides to iron ore revenuesfrom a greater use of scrap across the steel value chain are expected to be offset by upsides for aluminium and copper – which are both essential for the electrificationof the global energy system, including electric vehicles,and the deployment of low-carbon power solutions suchas solar and wind.
Higher carbon prices may lift our operating cost baseacross the business, given our current carbon footprint and decarbonisation trajectory. However,higher carbon prices would also incentivise new abatement options, which would mitigate the longer-term cost impact on our business.
Importantly, the competitive position of our assets, both on industry cash cost and carbon intensity curves, is expected to protect the margins of our assets, even for commodities such as iron ore where we may face a negative impact on demand and price. In the case of aluminium, the attractiveness of our hydro-basedassets is expected to increase relative to coal-based smelters, which would face increased carbon costs thatmay result in higher aluminium prices.
The impacts on our business will depend on the paceof the transition but we expect to remain profitable.
We also believe that we have the financial and human capacity to manage the impact of the transition to a low-carbon economy.
The table on the following page provides a high-level summary of our portfolio resilience analysis under the IEA SDS scenario.

Portfolio resilience analysis (IEA SDS scenario)Our approach to climate change 8 Our approach to climate change
Climate change is a topic of on-going discussion and analysis at the most seniorlevels of management and by the Board.
The Board approves our climate policy and sets the Group’s ambition and emissions targets. The Sustainability Committee of the Board is responsible for monitoring performance against the targets and ensuring operational-level resilience.
The Sustainability Committee also has oversight of key sustainability risk areasthat may be related to climate change,such as biodiversity and water, including the effectiveness of associated controls.
The Board also discussed industry association memberships and approved the disclosure of our review of associations’ climate policy positions.
In addition, members of our Board have participated in numerous discussions focusing on climate change with civil society organisations and investors.
Strengthening the link between executive remuneration andour climate targets
Our Chief executive’s performance objectives are reflected in his Short Term
Incentive Plan, which includes delivery of the Group’s strategy on climate consistentwith the new 2030 targets. These are cascaded down into the annual objectives of relevant members of the Executive
Committee and other members of senior management.
Our climate change strategy is embeddedin our business strategy, and aligned withour overall approach to sustainability.
Climate risks and opportunities haveformed part of our strategic thinking and investment decisions for over two decades, and we now have a portfolio thatis well positioned for the transition to a low-carbon economy. Some 76% of the power consumption at our managed operations already comes from renewableenergy and we are the only major diversified mining company not involved infossil fuel extraction.
Responsibility for identifying, evaluating and managing the risks associated withclimate change lies with all our employees and business leaders, operating within a
Group-wide risk management framework and approved limits. Our risk frameworklays out a three lines of defence approach to managing risks and controls:
• First line: employees and businessleaders own risks.
• Second line: our central support functions and Risk Management
Committee oversee our risk framework and internal control systems.
• Third line: Group Internal Audit assures our internal control systems.
Rio Tinto has an enterprise-wide risk management information system where all material risks and actions, includingthose related to climate change, are documented and kept current for managing and reporting purposes. Our
Critical Risk Assessment process is firmlyfounded in site-specific exposures, including those related to climate changesuch as wildfires, cyclones, floods, and landslides at a more regional level.
The Board met seven times in and covered climate changeon five separate occasions. At the two strategy meetings (in April and September 2019), the Board discussed the Group’s long-termclimate change ambition andoptions for operational emissions targets, having considered different abatement options and offsets. In November 2019, the
Board further considered andagreed in principle the Group’s long-term climate change ambition, 2030 emissions targetsand the financing of our climate change initiatives.

Partnering toreduce the carbon footprintacross our value chain
Climate change willonly be solved through collectiveaction by governments, business and consumers around the globe. We areworking on innovative partnerships to stimulate action with customers and other partners across the value chain. We are also participating in industry forums and advocating policy positions to promoteclimate action in a responsible and sustainable way.
See page 20for more details.
Enhancing our resilience to physical climate risks
We consider climaterisks over the life of our operations, from the development of new projects throughto closure and beyond. We have already experiencedextreme weatherevents at many of oursites and are using scenarios to assess further mediumto long-term risks.

Producing materials essential for a low-carbon future
We supply the metals and minerals essentialto human progress.
Each of the commodities weproduce has a role toplay in the transitionto a low-carbon economy.
See page 12for more details.
Reducingthe carbon footprint of our operations
Many of our operations are highly energy-intensive andsome of our industrial processes also result in GHG emissions. Weare taking steps to enhance productivity and efficiency, as well as exploring alternative sources ofenergy and developing innovative pathwaysto reduce emissions.
Our ambition is toreach net zero emissions by 2050.
Our 2030 targets areto reduce our emissions intensity by% and our absolute emissions by 15%
(or approximately.8mt CO2e).
See page 14for more details.
Our climate change strategy is focused on four areas
Moving from strategy to execution
Our work on climate change involves the contribution and alignment of many parts of our business. One of our most important decisions was to move responsibility for the climate change strategy to the Corporate Strategy team, which puts theissue at the heart of our business strategy. In September, we established our Energy & Climate Change Centre of Excellencewhich sits within our Growth & Innovation group. It will coordinateand drive the execution of our energy and greenhouse gas reductions through our climate change network by:
• Supporting the transfer of best practices in the execution of ourenergy and climate change strategy across the Group.
• Tracking the progress of our emissions reductions and abatement project pipeline so that we meet our targets and ambition of net zero emissions by 2050.
• Linking operations to viable technology solutions and partners, and promoting the development of technologies that currentlydo not exist by partnering with external technology developers, suppliers and customers.
• Evaluating the potential use of offsets. 2 3 4
Performance against our strategic climate change prioritiesOur approach to climate change 10 Our approach to climate change
From Australia to the Arctic Circle, from mine to market, we produce the materials used by our customers and their customers around the worldto make the things that society uses every day. The materials we produce, from infinitely recyclable aluminium to copper used in electrification to our high-grade iron ore product used to build machinery, bridges, railways and buildings, all play a part in the transition to a low-carbon economy.
We believe there are three elements relevant to our industry to consider in the transition:. a shift away from fossil fuels and focus on higher energy efficiencies and energy storage;. increased electrification of transportation, industrial processes and domestic heating; and. increased material re-use and recycling ie the circular economy
Producing materials essentialfor a low-carbon future
Each of the products we producewill play a role
Iron ore is used in steel, the fundamental building block of industry and infrastructure. Our higher-grade ores contribute to reducing GHG and other air emissions in China and elsewhere.
Copper is the primary conductorin the world’s electrical infrastructure contributing to electrification of transportationand smart technologies. For example, electric vehicles usethree to four times more copper than traditional internal combustion engine cars.
Aluminium is light, strong, conductive, flexible, corrosionresistant and infinitely recyclable.
Our clean, hydro-powered aluminium business in Québec,
Canada supplies customers in the food, consumer goods and car industry with sustainable materials that reduce the carboncontent of their products.
Our titanium dioxide business isworking on the development of low-cost metal powders for 3D printing to replace cast metal, thereby reducing energy consumption and waste in the aerospace industry and elsewhere.
We are also evaluating a worldclass lithium business which willprovide a vital material for electric vehicles and battery storage, supporting renewable energy. Our
Ventures team is also exploring additional partnerships and investment opportunities intoother battery minerals critical for a low-carbon economy.

PERFORMANCE AGAINST OUR STRATEGIC CLIMATE CHANGE PRIORITIESOur approach to climate change 12 Our approach to climate change
PERFORMANCE AGAINST OUR STRATEGIC CLIMATE CHANGE PRIORITIES
Overall, our marginal abatement costcurves show that some emissions reduction opportunities – such as energy efficiency and renewables projects – can generate a positive return on investment, although these are typically below our usual investment thresholds. Other opportunities – such as investments inhybrid mine vehicles or plasma torches –are not readily available to deploy at scaletoday or would generate returns that are negative. In other words, there is currently no commercial case for investment inthese types of opportunities.
Aluminium
Our aluminium business is well positionedwith a substantial proportion of electricity consumption met by hydropower. However, the Boyne and Tomago aluminium smelters in Australia are both supplied by coal-fired power generators. The development of low-carbon solutions for these assets musttake into account the local economic andenergy policy context.
Even with 100% renewable power, the aluminium smelting process produces substantial emissions from the use and degradation of carbon anodes. The
ELYSISTM joint venture is developing inert anode technology, which has been piloted successfully and is now progressing to larger-scale development. If deployed at scale, this could reduce emissions from our aluminium smelters by over 6 million tonnes by 2050.
In the long term, our alumina business willneed a low-emissions alternative toreplace the coal and natural gas used in our refineries. Decarbonising industrialheat is particularly challenging. Hydrogen or renewable electricity-powered plasma technologies may play a role in this process.
Minerals
Similar to our aluminium operations, our titanium dioxide business sources hydropower in Canada but relies on coal-fired power at Richards Bay Minerals in South Africa, in a context where developing low-carbon solutions will also require negotiations with multiple stakeholders and a balancing of decarbonisation outcomes and local economic development priorities.
Iron ore
Emissions from our iron ore business in the
Pilbara are mostly related to the natural gasused to power our system of mines and processing plants, and from the diesel consumed by our mobile fleet and rail network operations. In the medium term, our abatement opportunities come from the deployment of renewable power projects.
We have a range of solar and wind solutions
– supported by large-scale storage batteries – under investment proposaland planned for near-term execution.
Developing low-carbon solutions for ourmobile fleet and rail is more challenging.
This could be addressed in the longerterm by electrifying mining equipment and progressively shifting to zero-carbon mobile fleets (whether electric or hydrogen-fuelled) including both trucks and rail. However, the low-carbon alternatives are not yet commercially and technically viable, so it will be essential forus to work in partnerships with vehicle manufacturers and others in the mining sector.
Copper
Electricity and diesel for mobile equipment are also the main sources of emissions in our copper business. At our
Kennecott copper operations in the US, wehave shut down our coal power plant and purchased renewable energy certificates.
This reduces the operations’ annual carbon footprint by 65% – or the equivalent of more than a million tonnesof carbon dioxide – by sourcing lowercarbon electricity in the open market.
Escondida, our joint venture copper mine in Chile, has announced renewable power contracts which will replace coal-fired power generation from 2021, with the mine supplied by 100% renewable energysources from the mid-2020s.
The Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine in
Mongolia is currently supplied by coal-fired power and developing low-cost, low-carbon solutions will be more challenging and require negotiations with multiple stakeholders, including suppliers and governments.
Government regulation, such as carbon pricing, and other incentives is essential to encourage investment in these commercially unviable abatement options.
Continued engagement with governments, customers, suppliers and technology partners is essential to develop solutionsthat are both technically and commercially viable.
Pathways to long-term decarbonisation
In 2019, we completed an asset-by-asset analysis of mitigation options to inform our 2030 targets and long-term decarbonisation pathways. Our Energy and
Climate Change Centre of Excellence worked with ourproduct groups to identify potential emissions reductions opportunities across our asset portfolio. We assessed around 60 projects in detail and developed marginal abatement cost curves (MACC). In doing so, we have captured a wide range of knowledge and expertisewhich sets us up well to explore opportunities to reduce emissions through technology application and other means, now and in the future.

Based on our thorough analysis of decarbonisation pathways, our target isto reduce our emissions intensity by 30% by 2030, compared with our 2018 equity baseline (adjusted for divestments). We aimto reduce our absolute emissions by 15%
(or approximately 4.8Mt CO2e) over the same timeframe. This implies a need to find carbon-neutral approaches to growthacross our portfolio, which is a significant challenge as many new mining projects are in developing countries that have other national priorities, such as poverty alleviation and affordable, secure energy.
Repowering our aluminium assets and increasing the share of renewable electricity more broadly will be centralto our decarbonisation strategy to 2030.
In particular, we will pursue opportunitiesto replace natural gas with renewables to power our Pilbara operations.
We will continue to refine our analysis of emissions reduction opportunities over the short, medium and long term, and prioritise resources and research and development to help achieve our target.
We plan to invest around $1 billion overthe next five years in emissions reduction projects, research and development and enhancing the climate change resilienceof our business. This compares with capital expenditure of $5.5billion in 2019.
We have identified a pipeline of GHG reduction projects that we expect to implement over the next ten years toachieve our targets. The timing and scaleof these projects is dependent on anumber of factors.
Projects already identified for funding in 2020 include:
• Pilbara solar and battery storage project (34MW; $98 million)
• ELYSISTM
• Lower-carbon vehicles
• Partnership with Baowu Steel and
Tsinghua University
Our 2050 ambition
This year, we have set an ambition toreach net zero emissions by 2050. There is absolutely no doubt that we will face many technical and social challenges in achieving this and we do not have a clear pathway today. All of our operationalleaders and teams will focus on reducing emissions in their businesses as wepartner with others to develop new technology solutions and look for ways toimprove the quality of our products. Webelieve it is possible to achieve our ambition with coordinated governmentaction to create the right enabling environment to incentivise investment in new technology and changes in consumer behaviour, in addition to strong andfocused action by industry.
It is difficult to be precise about the long-term low-carbon transition of our business, particularly as the technical solutions are unproven and not economicin some cases. However, over the coming decades, technology will develop, regulation will change and higher carbonpricing will be implemented more widely.
This will enable us to accelerate the decarbonisation of our operations. The low-carbon transition must accelerate business action, be socially inclusive andaddress impacts on competitiveness. In some cases, trying to reduce emissionsmore quickly could have the undesirableoutcome of prompting plant closures and reducing employment. This would have a particularly negative impact on remote communities who often rely on mining and smelting for their livelihoods. It is therefore critical that we work with all stakeholders as we pursue the ambitionof net zero by 2050. decarbonisation pathway
PERFORMANCE AGAINST OUR STRATEGIC CLIMATE CHANGE PRIORITIES
REDUCING THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF OUR OPERATIONS
Exploring the potential of investment in natural climate solutions
Given the high cost of emissions reductions for parts of our business, our long-term ambition is for our operations to be net zero emissions by 2050, rather than zero emissions.
Carbon removals and offsets will therefore form part of our decarbonisation strategy. We appreciate the concerns about the integrity of forest carbon offsets.
We support the mitigation hierarchy outlined by the World Business Council on Sustainable Development (WBCSD): companies should prioritise avoiding and minimising emissions before using offsets.
We would adhere to the four principles that WBCSD and Nature4Climate recommend for any investment in
Natural Climate Solutions (NCS):. Raise ambition with respect to climate action.. Provide an interim solution for hard-to-abate emissions, but not a permanent one.. Deliver environmental and social safeguards and benefits in addition to GHG emissions reductions.. Apply sound and verified carbon measurement and accounting methodologies to ensure high environmental integrity of
NCS credits.
From 2020, we will evaluate the potential to implement natural climate solutions at our sites as part of work toenhance the productive use of the largeland areas we manage. If NCS opportunities are implemented effectively, they may also have the potential to provide wider benefits.
These include ecosystem servicessuch as water infiltration, soil health, improved biodiversity and flood buffering as well as community and social benefits.

Emissions reduction performance
The work to decarbonise our businessstarted many years ago. Many of our operations are energy intensive and wehave been taking action to improve both productivity and efficiency, as we reduce emissions. This starts with making surewe have a strong understanding of howenergy in our business is used, constantly assessing low-emission technology opportunities, and building our own capability to innovate.
The carbon intensity of our assets varieswidely across our portfolio, and largely reflects the balance between mining and processing activities. Operations with a predominant mining and logistics focus are generally situated in the lower part of the Group’s carbon intensity curve.
Meanwhile, alumina refining, aluminium smelting and the upgrading of titanium feedstocks are all high temperature, energy-intensive processes, pushing suchassets to the right of the intensity curveand lifting the Group’s average carbon intensity to 6.4tCO2e / tCu-eq.
Moving from managed to equitybased emissions reporting
We currently report the emissions fromassets we manage. From 2020, our emissions reporting will be on an equity basis. This also means adding the equityshare of managed joint ventures such asparts of our Pilbara operations, Boyne
Smelters Limited and Oyu Tolgoi. It also includes our share of our non-managed joint ventures such as the Tomago
Aluminium, Queensland Alumina Limited and Escondida copper mine. This will increase our reported emissions from.4Mt CO2e (managed) to 31.8Mt CO2e
(equity) for the 2018 baseline used for our new targets. In future, we will adjust this emissions baseline to account for acquisitions and divestment.
In 2008, we set our first climate change target, to reduce the GHG emissions intensity of our managed operations. Ourlatest target called for a 24% reduction in intensity by 2020. We continued to beatthat target last year, managing a 29% reduction in intensity by the end of 2019 against the 2008 baseline.
We have also reduced the absolute emissions from our managed operations to 26.4Mt CO2e in 2019, a 46% reduction since 2008, or around 18% if excluding divestments.
Today, 76% of our electricity consumptionis already sourced from renewable energy
(primarily hydro-electric power), compared with 26% of global electricity production.
So today, even our most carbon-intensiveassets are favourably positioned within their respective industry contexts. Most ofour assets are in the bottom half of carbon intensity curves, reflecting better energy efficiencies than their peers and a higher proportion of low-carbon energy sourcing.
In Canada, for example, the emissionsfrom our smelters are only 2.3tCO2 pertonne of aluminium, around 80% below the industry average and close to 90%below typical coal-fired smelters in China.
Our Vaudreuil alumina refinery in Québec,
Canada has the lowest carbon footprint inthe world today.

Notes: 1. excluding emissions from smelting and refining 19Our approach to climate change Our approach to climate change
We have an important role to play in advancing climate action but wecannot do this alone. Everyone, including business, government, customers, suppliers and consumers, needs to work together.
Government policy that creates the right framework for change is critical, coupled with real business action and societal shifts. We believe collaboration across countries, industries and society is key to achieving the systemic change needed to meet climate challenges.
This is why we are working with partners – including many of our customers – through the value chain to explore solutions to tackleclimate change and collectively improve environmental performance;why we are involved in key climate policy discussions such as the World
Bank’s carbon pricing competitiveness analysis; why we take part inclimate action initiatives such as the Energy Transitions Commissionand why we actively engage in industry forums.
Climate policy advocacy
We actively engage on climatechange policy with governments, industry associations, investorsand civil society in the countrieswhere we operate. We are guidedby our overall policy position that supports market mechanisms including carbon pricing, as webelieve this is the best way of stimulating innovation and achieving emissions reductionsat least cost.
Effective climate policies should incentivise the private sector toinvest in low-carbon technology, while avoiding the negative unintended consequences of transferring industrial production to countries with weaker emissions regulation. A challenge as seriousas climate change requires transparency, collaboration and a shared contribution to the solution.

Greenhouse gas emissions across our value chains
Our operational footprint of 31.8Mt CO2e represents less than 0.1% of global CO2 emissions. However, we operate withinvalue chains which have significant scale globally, from the extraction of minerals inthe ground to the manufacturing and use of consumer products. These value chainsinclude some processing steps which arehighly energy and carbon intensive such as aluminium smelting or steelmaking.
Emissions from across the aluminiumvalue chain account for less than 3% of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry. Around 80% of these occur at the smelting phase, which convertsalumina into primary aluminium metal.
In turn, just over a quarter of these aluminium smelting emissions come from the combustion of carbon anodes, with therest mostly from the generation or purchase of electricity. The energy sourceused for that electricity, is therefore thekey factor driving the carbon intensity of an aluminium smelter, which as shown previously ranges widely from aroundtCO2e / t Al for hydro-based smelters to around 17t CO2e / t Al for smeltersusing coal fired power.
As noted already, our aluminium business,with a high share of hydro-based electricity, has a competitive carbonintensity footprint compared to the rest of the industry. Around 70% of the bauxite we produce, as well as some alumina, issold to third parties, including customers in China. These customers generally have alumina refineries and smelters withhigher carbon intensities than our own operations. We estimate their emissionsfrom the processing of our bauxite andalumina into primary aluminium add up to around 112Mt CO2e, based on industry average intensities.

Emissions throughout the steel value chain
Steelmaking is less carbon intensive than aluminium, but the steel industry operates at a significantly greater scale with emissions across its value chain accounting for about 9% of global CO2 emissions from fossil fuels and industry.
Emissions at the mining phase accountfor less than 5% of the overall carbon footprint of the steel value chain. Most of the emissions are generated at the steel making stage, both as part of the sintering and coke-making processes aswell as in the blast furnace and oxygen furnace (BF/BOF) where iron ore is converted into steel. There is some variability in the carbon intensity of integrated steel mills based on operating performance and the input materials used, but this produces only small deviations around an average of just above 2 tonnes of CO2 per tonne of crudesteel for the BF/BOF route.
In 2019, we produced and shipped aroundMt of iron ore products (Rio Tinto equity share) and generated in the process.2Mt of scope 1 & 2 CO2 emissions across our Pilbara and Iron Ore Canada (IOC) operations. We estimate that, in turn, our customers produced around 373Mt CO2 emissions from the processing of our iron ore products into steel. Our higher-grade ores, including lumps and IOC pellets, contribute to our customers’ managementof their carbon footprint.
We estimate emissions from shippingall our products to add up to around.2Mt CO2 , based on shipping sector emissions factors.
After the processing stage, primarymetals such as steel, aluminium andcopper are transformed into semifabricated products (extrusions, sheets, plates, wires, etc.) and then into partsthat get assembled into final products
(buildings, cars, machineries, consumer goods, etc.). Emissions from this part ofthe value chain as well as through the lifecycle of end products are more difficult to quantify. In many cases, the ultimate useof the materials we produce will actually contribute towards reducing emissions compared with alternative solutions.
For example, the increased use of aluminium in cars is helping to managetheir fuel efficiency by reducing their weight. Copper is a highly efficient electrical conductor and a key material for low-carbon technologies such as wind or solar power. Steel is essential to the construction of modern cities and their infrastructure, which provide more efficient energy or transport solutions.
This is why we believe that we are well positioned to supply the materials essentialto human progress and to the transitionto a low-carbon economy.
The metals we produce or those produced by our customers from our raw materials also have the benefit ofbeing easily recyclable. And the energyand carbon intensity of producing secondary aluminium or steel is significantly lower than the primary metal processing activities described above.

Climate leadership forums and industry associations
Energy Transition Commission
In early 2019, we joined the Energy
Transitions Commission (ETC), a group ofleaders from public, private and socialsectors who meet to advance the goal of accelerating change towards low-carbonenergy and industrial processes. The ETC is particularly focused on technical solutions to reduce emissions from the hard-to-abate industrial and transportsectors of the economy, such as steel, shipping and aluminium.
Industry Associations
We believe that industry associations have an important role in sharing best practice and developing standards. Industry associations provide us with an opportunity to better understand a range of external views and to contribute our perspectives and experiences in supportof good policy outcomes which benefit business, the economy and society.
We recognise there is increasing stakeholder interest in the nature of industry associations and the role theyplay in policy advocacy. This is particularly relevant when associations represent a membership with disparate views. In, we updated our review of our industry association memberships, listingthe top five industry groups by membership fees and industry groups actively engaged on climate policy issues.
The review highlights industry associations that have adopted positionson climate change that differ significantlyfrom our public policy position.
We continually review the value of our membership of individual industry associations prior to joining and when membership is due for renewal. Where significant differences in policy positions arise, we may:
• Provide greater clarity on our own policy positions, such as company submissions on policy issues and/or direct engagement with policy makers.
• Work as part of that industry association to understand alternative points ofview and to seek common ground that enables progress to be made.
• Ultimately, if differences in policy positions appear to be incapable of being resolved, consider reviewing our membership of that industry association.

Aluminium Stewardship Initiative
As a founding member of the Aluminium
Stewardship Initiative, we have helpedpioneer social and environmentally responsible production standards for the aluminium industry alongside customersand a broad range of other stakeholders.
In 2018, we became the first producer to offer ASI Aluminium through a “chain of custody” spanning the Gove bauxite mine in Australia to our alumina refinery, aluminium smelters and casthouses in
Québec, Canada, adding our operations in
British Columbia in 2019.
We now offer independently certified, responsibly produced aluminium from our smelters in Australia and New Zealand that predominantly use hydro-powered electricity. ASI has granted its
Performance Standard and Chain of
Custody certifications to our Amrun and
Weipa bauxite mines, Yarwun alumina refinery, and the Bell Bay and NZAS aluminium smelters. This strengthens ourability to offer ASI aluminium throughoutour global supply chain, building on the certifications in place for our Canadian operations.
ASI certification means customers can beassured that the aluminium they purchasehas been produced with high environmental, social and governance standards, ranging from greenhouse gas emissions to human rights. This certificationexpands our offering of independently certified, responsibly produced aluminium to customers around the world. It continues our leadership on responsible aluminium production from mine to market, so that our customers can meet growing consumerdemand for sustainably sourced materials.
ELYSISTM
In 2018, in partnership with Alcoa andwith support from Apple and the governments of Canada and Québec, we announced ELYSISTM the world’s first carbon-free aluminium smelting process.
The ELYSIS joint venture is further developing a breakthrough inert anode technology – the most significant innovation in the aluminium industry formore than a century. This will eliminate all direct greenhouse gases from the traditional aluminium smelting process, instead producing pure oxygen.
In Canada alone, the use of ELYSISTM technology has the potential to reduce
GHG emissions by 7 million tonnes – equivalent to taking 1.8 million cars off the road.
In August 2019, ELYSIS marked the start of construction on its new Research and
Development Centre at Rio Tinto’s
Complexe Jonquière in Canada. The
C$50 million construction project is expected to be fully operational in 2020, employing 25 technical experts. Our technology team in France is creating commercial scale designs for the ELYSISTM technology so it can be retrofitted into existing smelters or used for new ones.
In December 2019, Apple purchased the first commercial batch of aluminium from
ELYSISTM.
Value chain partnerships
We partner with our customers to find collaborative solutions and share best practice. The nature of these partnershipsdepends on our position in the value chain,and we do this in different ways dependingon the product value chain. As shownabove the significant emissions occurringin the steel value chain are from our customers who are mainly major steel producers in China, Korea and Japan.
Our Aluminium business works with customers throughout the value chain to provide technical support to improve the efficiency of their refineries and smelters.
We will continue to focus on commercial partnerships to support emissions reductions as new technologies become available. During 2019 we started anumber of new environment and climate change partnerships and further developed existing ones.
Baowu, CISA, Tsinghua University
In September, Rio Tinto signed a partnership Memorandum of
Understanding with China’s largest steel producer, China Baowu Steel Group and
Tsinghua University, one of China’s most prestigious and influential universities, todevelop and implement new methods toreduce carbon emissions and improve environmental performance across thesteel value chain. The China Iron and Steel
Association (CISA) hosted the signing of the MOU at its China International Steel and Raw Materials Conference held in
Qingdao. A working group has been established to:
• explore technical cooperation and capacity-building to strengthen greenhouse gas inventory and reporting programmes;
• research, design and implement initiatives to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the whole steel value chain;
• cooperate to advance multilateral and subnational action on climate changein the steel sector. 27Our approach to climate change Our approach to climate change
World Bank:carbon pricing and competitiveness
In 2019, our Chief executive participated in the High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing and
Competitiveness.
As governments and industry aim to achieve growthwhile also addressing the threat of climate change, carbon pricing, whether in the form of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme, has emerged as an indispensable part of a strategy to reducing emissions in an efficient way.
However, the possibility that putting a price on carbonmay have an adverse effect on the competitiveness of a carbon-intensive firm, sector or country, is often a majorconcern for industry and policy makers considering the introduction of this type of policy. For industry the concern is partially about the low-carbon transition challenge and partially about the potential for international competitors to have an unfair advantage if they do not facea similar carbon price.
– High-Level Commission on Carbon Pricing and Competitiveness
PERFORMANCE AGAINST OUR STRATEGIC CLIMATE CHANGE PRIORITIES
We consider climate-related risks over the life of our operations,from design to closure and beyond. We have already seen theimpact of extreme weather events at many of our sites and we are using scenarios to assess the probability and potential impact ofthese risks in the future. The two types of physical risks that we focuson are acute and chronic climate risks, and an explanation of each is given below. Enhancing our resilience to physical climate risks
Changes to the intensity and frequency of extreme events, such as tropical cyclones, storm surges, wildfires or extreme heat days, have the potential to damage infrastructure and interrupt business operations. This could impact on health, increase operational costsand result in loss of revenue from reduced production. The changingnature of extreme weather eventsalso has the potential to impactthe design criteria for new projectsand for closure.
Climate change and energy considerations are built into the study definition guidelines thatsupport our project developmentand closure processes. However, infrastructure design criteria can become outdated as climate science advances, so there is arisk that compliance with existing engineering codes and standards provides insufficient resilience forfuture extreme weather events.
Longer-term trends can be more difficult to identify and respond to.
For example: warming temperatures could significantly reduce the usability of ice roads in sub-arctic locations, resulting in supply chain disruptions and increased operational costs; rainfall patternsmay vary both in terms of average rainfall, and seasonal variability, impacting water availability and requiring stronger discipline in water balance management. This could have knock-on, indirect impacts, including on the health of our employees and the wider communities where we operate.
We anticipate that energy use profiles at facilities may change, particularly where energy isused for heating or cooling.
Acute climate risks Chronic climate risksOur approach to climate change 28 Our approach to climate change
In last year’s climate change report we summarised the results of our assessment of physical climate risks to our assets. These results focus on the potential exposure of the regions in whichwe operate through to the end of the century, both for our existing assets andfuture project developments. This analysisused a scenario (Representative
Concentration Pathway 8.5) from the
IPCC’s 5th assessment report.
This analysis highlights that our Pilbara operations have a high exposure to all physical climate risk variables, and are material to Group revenue. We have many years’ experience in assessing and managing extreme weather risks and impacts, as well as in enhancing the resilience of our Pilbara assets. In 2006, six cyclones passed through the Pilbara, flooding mines and disrupting our operations for several weeks. In 2009, flooding shut down part of our railwaynetwork while bridges and culverts were repaired. In December 2013, Tropical
Cyclone Christine, resulted in loss of essential services to residential towns and operational disruption.
In March 2019, Tropical Cyclone Veronicacaused some damage to the Cape
Lambert port facility in Western Australia.
As a result, we declared force majeure on certain contracts and worked with our customers to minimise any disruption in supply.
Rapid recovery of essential services and central coordination of workforce kept interruptions to a minimum. Learningsfrom these events have led to a number of initiatives to enhance our resilience and informed our preparedness for futureevents at these and similar assets.
We have a series of controls to managethe threat of extreme weather in the
Pilbara. These controls include structural integrity programmes across all mine, railand port system-critical assets, ensuringour people are trained in: response, weather monitoring, infrastructure inspections and dynamic scheduling.

Climate considerations in water management
We work in some environments where water is scarce – like the
Gobi Desert in Mongolia – and others with large variations in rainfall from year to year – like Weipa in far North Australia. Based on the World Business Council Global Water Assessment Tool, in 41%% of our managed sites were assessed as located in a
“water stressed” environment. Of these sites, only one was locally assessed as having its operations marginally impacted by water availability. Many of our sites are likely to experience changes in rainfall and water availability due to climate change, so we takethis into consideration too.
Whatever the context, we see ourselves as water stewards and wetake this commitment seriously, because water is essential – notjust for human life, health, and the environment, but also for economic prosperity. Our processing plants, refineries, and smelters and mines use water to process ore, manage dust and promote rehabilitation. In some instances, water is used to produce hydroelectricity to power our operations and minimise our emissions to the environment. As such, changes in water availability will impact not just our operations, but how we mitigate our impacts on the environment as well.
We are committed to balancing our operational needs with thoseof local communities, and ecosystems, as we meet local and international regulatory requirements. We seek to avoid disturbance or degradation of water resources like lakes, streams and groundwater aquifers, and to control the quality and quantityof the water we use and then return it to the environment. Wealso seek to use water as efficiently as possible in the design and everyday operations of our sites.
Water targets remain a core part of our water management approach. The 2019-2023 Water Strategy represents the third implementation of water targets for our business and demonstrates a maturing in the understanding of the importance and relevance of our work in this key area.
We have created new water targets, learning from past experience, which will build the datasets we need to drive good water stewardship in the future. We aim to use these targets anddata to improve our performance over the next five years through a programme of risk awareness and response.
Today, more than 80% of the water used in production is recycled and, on average, Oyu
Tolgoi uses around half the industry averageper tonne of processed copper ore.
The Oyu Tolgoi copper mine is situatedin the southern Gobi desert of Mongolia, approximately 550 kilometres south of the capital, Ulaanbaatar, and 80 kilometres north of the Mongolia-China border. The mine is locatedin an arid, water-scarce region that is already being impacted by climate variability and increased desertification. As a consequence, optimising water management was a key design objective for Oyu Tolgoi.
We have invested in recycling and conservation practicesthat make it one of the most water-efficient mines of itskind in the world. These include:
• use of an advanced tailings thickener that reduces water consumption within the tailings transfer and deposition process;
• placement of a plastic cover on the water lagoon to reduce evaporative water loss;
• operational awareness and education on the importance of recycling and conservation practices;
• complete treatment and reuse of all domestic wastewater;
• established efficiency target and zero water discharge commitment to the environment;
• comprehensive water monitoring programme. 33Our approach to climate change Our approach to climate change
Climate change represents an unprecedented challenge forthe world and for our business. But as producers of the materials essential to human progress, we believe it also presents opportunities for us. Our portfolio is well positioned for the transitionto a low-carbon future, but there is much more to be done, bothwithin our business and in partnership with others.
We have considered climate change as part of our strategy for twodecades and it is fully integrated into our strategic planning, risk and governance processes.
Our ambition is to reach net zero emissions by 2050 across our operations. We have set new targets to reduce our emissions intensity by 30% by 2030 and our absolute emissions by 15% overthe same timeframe. To help us achieve our ambition and targets,we plan to invest around $1 billion over five years in emissions reduction projects, research and development.
Since 2008 we have reduced the absolute emissions from our managed operations by 46%. Today, 76% of our electricity consumption is from renewable energy, compared with 26% of global electricity production. Most of our operations already have significantly lower carbon intensities than sector averages. We also continue to work on new technology solutions such as our partnership with Alcoa and Apple, to produce aluminium without any direct CO2 emissions.
We have made significant progress, but we are reaching the limits ofwhat a responsible business, acting alone, can achieve through incremental change. Enabling regulation is essential to provide a business case for investment in many of the hard-to-abate sectorswithin the mining and metals value chain. And unilateral action would potentially harm our employees, our customers, the communities around our operations, local and state governmentsand our shareholders.
We are ready to play our role in tackling the climate change challenge and we believe we are well positioned to be part of the solution, working in partnership with other businesses, technology developers, investors, consumers and civil society.
But we also recognise the essential role of governments aroundthe world to create the legal and regulatory certainty and incentives necessary for investment and innovation. The best solution will come from global collaboration.
